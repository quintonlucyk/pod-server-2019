# Pod Server 2019
Pod Server for 2018-2019 Waterloop Pod

This is a `wio` application.

To build this application:
```bash
make
```
### Look at `make.sh` to see what the default make does to build our app.


To clean this application:
```bash
make clean
```
### Look at `clean.sh` to see what make clean does to clean our app.

Todo: 
    - Get the wio package to build as an app.
    - Write our own server (tweak according to our needs).
